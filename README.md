- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mazlai.

- 👀 I’m interested in frontend development of applications or websites (using HTML, CSS, JS) but also in back-end development including SQL, PHP...

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java (for object-oriented programming), C (for computer architecture), PHP (for dynamic web pages), SQL (for databases), UNIX (for terminals) and Python as part of my studies.
 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on on a large project, consisting of making an application (all themes are welcome), usable on all media.
